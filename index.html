The strikes destroyed much of the equipment of government forces, including tanks and artillery, and after about twelve hours pro-Gaddafi troops retreated from the area. </p>\
<p>All troops save individual snipers are reported to have left Misrata, marking the end of five days of attacks by government forces seeking to retake control of the city. The assault has reportedly killed close to a hundred people.</p>\
<p>According to a witness, Mohammed Ali, who works at the main hospital, aircraft 'bombed a lot of sites of the Gaddafi army. There is a former hospital where his tanks were based. All the tanks and the hospital were destroyed. A column of tanks was destroyed on the edge of the city. [...] All that is left is [sic] the snipers and our fighters can take care of them.'</p>\
<p>He went on to say that 94 people have died since government forces began their attack on the city, with more than 1,300 having been injured.</p>",

                         "lead" : "Expectations were certainly high for the launch of californian computer giant Apple's first update of its tablet platform, the iPad 2. But blowing targets well out of the water, the iPad 2 sold out of stock in the first weekend. Analysts estimate that this puts it well ahead of the original iPad in terms of sales.",
                         "body" : "<p>The new version of Apple Inc.'s tablet computing device, the iPad 2, has gone on sale in the United States at Apple Stores and a number of other retailers (including Wal-Mart, Target, Sam's Club, Best Buy, Verizon, and AT&T), a shift from last year's launch which was only available through Apple's stores. The product will go on sale internationally on March 25.</p> \
 \
<p>The device was announced on March 2 at an event at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, California. CEO Steve Jobs emerged from sick leave to make the announcement.</p>\
 \
<p>The iPad 2 has an all-new design and has several improvements over the original iPad. The device runs on a dual-core Apple A5 CPU. According to Jobs, the CPU's new dual-core capability enhances multitasking and doubles the processing speed. Apple additionally introduced a magnetic 'Smart Cover' accessory that snaps to the front screen of the device along with several new apps ported from the Mac OS X operating system and the iPhone. These include iMovie, GarageBand, and Photo Booth. The new iPad introduces front and rear cameras which enable FaceTime and video. The new tablet is fifteen percent lighter and 33 percent thinner than the previous version—thinner than an iPhone 4—and has beveled edges. It is available in black and white and continues to be capable of ten hours of battery life on a single charge.</p>",

The video has attracted over thirty-five million views since its February 10 upload — and critics think it could be the world's worst.</p> \
 \
<p>Ark Music Factory produced the song and video, using US$2,000 (£1,223, C$1,964, €1,412) from Black's mother. Friday's video was shot at Black's father's house, with her family and friends as extras. The song beat an alternative track when choosing what to record.</p> \
\
<p>The single is climbing up the iTunes singles chart in the United Kingdom and the United States, gaining a higher position in the US than Canadian singer Justin Bieber.</p> \
\
<p>Despite the song's popularity, it has received a largely negative reception. According to Newsbeat, critics have cited Friday as being 'the worst song of all time.' On YouTube, the video attracted approximately thirty-six thousand 'likes' versus over 314,000 'dislikes'. The song itself has been ridiculed for its lyrics and criticised for its use of Auto-Tune.\
Feeling 'like she was being cyber-bullied,' Rebecca Black said 'when I first saw all these nasty comments I thought this is all my fault, ... this was all because of me.' Black says of 'those hurtful comments', the worst was 'I hope you cut yourself and I hope you get an eating disorder so you look pretty. I hope you cut and die.' Clarence Jey, of Ark Music Factory, offered to take the video off YouTube, but Black declined.\
In contrast, British music executive Simon Cowell has expressed a positive interest in Rebecca Black. 'I love her and the fact she's gotten so much publicity,' Cowell commented. 'People are so upset about the song, but I think it's hysterical. I want to meet her. Anyone who can create this much controversy within a week, I want to meet. I love people like that.'\
Rebecca Black herself wants to record a duet with Justin Bieber. 'I have Bieber fever — I am in love with Justin Bieber,' Black commented. The teenager said it 'would be unbelievable and make my life'.\

The emperor made his announcement shortly after technicians working to stabilise a nuclear plant temporarily abandoned it as radiation started to surge.</p> \
 \
<p>The emperor's appearance caused television stations to interrupt scheduled programming. During his appearance he said 'I hope from the bottom of my heart that the people will, hand in hand, treat each other with compassion and overcome these difficult times.' The 77 year-old is deeply respected in Japan.</p> \
 \
<p>A statement by the Imperial household said Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko want to visit the area affected by the tsunami, but the important thing now is rescuing the victims. In 1995 the emperor and empress visited Kobe after an earthquake struck and killed 6,400 people.</p> \
 \
<p>Around 10,000 people are feared to be dead after the earthquake and tsunami hit the north-east coast of the country. More than 100 countries have offered rescue services in an attempt to save as many people as possible.</p>",
